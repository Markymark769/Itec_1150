# # Example 1
# # in amazon when you shop, you have a list of things
# # within that shopping cart you have items separated by a list
# # some code like this is running when you add & subtract things from your shopping cart
# cart = ['charger','tumbler','screen protector']  # visualize each item in a container, counting from 0-2
# print(cart)  # print all the items
#
# cart.remove('tumbler')
# print(cart)  # user wants to delete something from the cart
#
# cart.append('headphones')
# print(cart)  # user adds something to your cart
# # the list stores information about the product, it is more complex than a string like we are doiong,
# # however thinking of it in a list is the correct concept to understand
#
# # we can think of lists as one thing
# first_item = cart[0]  # the list is made of individual items from the list
# print(first_item)  # this will print 'charger'

# guest list
# ex 1
# note) look at the todo list program to finish this first program
