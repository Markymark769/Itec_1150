1. Problem Definition: state the problem or need to be addressed in the program, and the result desired.
2. Problem Analysis: list variables and functions needed in the program â€“ give names & brief descriptions.
3. Algorithm Development: list out program steps in order (number your steps). For branching, use indentation
and/or illustration features of Word to show the flow.
4. Coding & Documentation: copy and paste your code here and submit the _________.py file separately.
5. Testing & Debugging: take screen snips of program test results, and paste in this section, with notes.
Test program with expected and unexpected input. Test as many times as necessary to prove your logic.
6. Maintenance/ Improvement: fixes needed, plus ideas for improved program features in the next version of the program.
