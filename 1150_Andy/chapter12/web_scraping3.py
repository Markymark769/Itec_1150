Al Sweigart Automate book Chapter 11
original name: web_scraping_lab_v2.py
 This program downloads a webpage, extracts a poem, saves the file, re-opens the file and displays its contents

 This program does what I originally wanted, which is to web scrape the poem "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"
    using BeautifulSoup. - which would've been much easier had I kept up on my HTML.

    I also generalized it more than the last rushed program so that the web scrape and extract are now two different functions
    along with correcting my variable names to lower case and making the file function names more fitting.
    I also changed the file save mode from write binary to just plain write.

# The stupid program doesnâ€™t work because it there needs to be validation for turning the raw html into text.
# Because the function explicitly is for retrieving html, we run into complications in retrieving the html
