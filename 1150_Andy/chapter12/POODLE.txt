 POODLE CVE identifier(s) CVE-2014-3566 Date discovered October 14, 2014 ; 9 years ago  ( 2014-10-14 ) Discoverer Bodo Möller, Thai Duong, Krzysztof Kotowicz ( Google  Security Team) Affected software Any software that supports a fallback to  SSL 3.0 
 POODLE  (which stands for " Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption ") is a  security vulnerability  which takes advantage of the fallback to  SSL 3.0 . [1] [2] [3]  If attackers successfully exploit this vulnerability, on average, they only need to make 256 SSL 3.0 requests to reveal one byte of encrypted messages. Bodo Möller, Thai Duong and Krzysztof Kotowicz from the  Google  Security Team discovered this vulnerability; they disclosed the vulnerability publicly on October 14, 2014 (despite the paper being dated "September 2014"  [1] ). [4]  On December 8, 2014, a variation of the POODLE vulnerability that affected  TLS  was announced. [5] 
 The  CVE-ID  associated with the original POODLE attack is  CVE - 2014-3566 .
F5 Networks filed for  CVE - 2014-8730  as well, see  POODLE attack against TLS  section below.
 
 
 Prevention [ edit ] 
 To mitigate the POODLE attack, one approach is to completely disable SSL 3.0 on the client side and the server side. However, some old clients and servers do not support TLS 1.0 and above. Thus, the authors of the paper on POODLE attacks also encourage browser and server implementation of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, [6]  which will make downgrade attacks impossible. [1] [7] 
 Another mitigation is to implement "anti-POODLE record splitting". It splits the records into several parts and ensures none of them can be attacked. However the problem of the splitting is that, though valid according to the specification, it may also cause compatibility issues due to problems in server-side implementations. [8] 
 A full list of browser versions and levels of vulnerability to different attacks (including POODLE) can be found in the article  Transport Layer Security .
 Opera  25 implemented this mitigation in addition to TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. [9] 
 Google's  Chrome  browser and their servers had already supported TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. Google stated in October 2014 it was planning to remove SSL 3.0 support from their products completely within a few months. [7]  Fallback to SSL 3.0 has been disabled in Chrome 39, released in November 2014. [10]  SSL 3.0 has been disabled by default in Chrome 40, released in January 2015. [11] 
 Mozilla  disabled SSL 3.0 in  Firefox  34 and ESR 31.3, which were released in December 2014, and added support of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV in Firefox 35. [12] 
 Microsoft  published a security advisory to explain how to disable SSL 3.0 in  Internet Explorer  and  Windows  OS, [13]  and on October 29, 2014, Microsoft released a fix which disables SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer on Windows Vista / Server 2003 and above and announced a plan to disable SSL 3.0 by default in their products and services within a few months. [14]  Microsoft disabled fallback to SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer 11 for Protect Mode sites on February 10, 2015, [15]  and for other sites on April 14, 2015. [16] 
 Apple's  Safari  (on OS X 10.8, iOS 8.1 and later) mitigated against POODLE by removing support for all CBC protocols in SSL 3.0, [17] [18]  however, this left RC4 which is also completely broken by the RC4 attacks in SSL 3.0. [ citation needed ] . POODLE was completely mitigated in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan 2015) and iOS 9 (2015).
 To prevent the POODLE attack, some web services dropped support of SSL 3.0. Examples include  CloudFlare [19]  and  Wikimedia . [20] 
 Network Security Services  version 3.17.1 (released on October 3, 2014) and 3.16.2.3 (released on October 27, 2014) introduced support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, [21] [22]  and NSS will disable SSL 3.0 by default in April 2015. [23] [ needs update ]   OpenSSL  versions 1.0.1j, 1.0.0o and 0.9.8zc, released on October 15, 2014, introduced support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. [24]   LibreSSL  version 2.1.1, released on October 16, 2014, disabled SSL 3.0 by default. [25] 
 
 POODLE attack against TLS [ edit ] 
 A new variant of the original POODLE attack was announced on December 8, 2014.  This attack exploits implementation flaws of  CBC encryption mode  in the TLS 1.0 - 1.2 protocols.  Even though TLS specifications require servers to check the padding, some implementations fail to validate it properly, which makes some servers vulnerable to POODLE even if they disable SSL 3.0. [5]   SSL Pulse showed "about 10% of the servers are vulnerable to the POODLE attack against TLS" before this vulnerability was announced. [26]   The CVE-ID for F5 Networks' implementation bug is  CVE - 2014-8730 .  The entry in NIST's NVD states that this CVE-ID is to be used only for F5 Networks' implementation of TLS, and that other vendors whose products have the same failure to validate the padding mistake in their implementations like  A10 Networks  and  Cisco Systems  need to issue their own CVE-IDs for their implementation errors because this is not a flaw in the protocol but in the implementation.
 The POODLE attack against TLS was found to be easier to initiate than the initial POODLE attack against SSL.  There is no need to downgrade clients to SSL 3.0, meaning fewer steps are needed to execute a successful attack. [27]
