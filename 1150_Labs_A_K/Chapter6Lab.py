"""1) text_validator.py â€“ until now, we have not validated text
input. But some text inputs should follow a pattern. Write a
short program that defines and calls a text validation
function. Its purpose is to validate a full name or a book
title (pick one).
In your function definition, ask the user for input, then
use .split() on the string entered, to turn it into a list of
words. That way, you can use a loop to check each word,
and correct capitalization and spacing. Then, you will add
each corrected word back to a new string, and return.
Hint: Inside the loop, use conditional logic to determine the
right fix for each word. Parts of names should stay in lower
case, like van, der, de or di. In book titles, prepositions and
articles are lower case, UNLESS they are the first word.
