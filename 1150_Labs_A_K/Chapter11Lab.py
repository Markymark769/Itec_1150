# 2) web_scraping1.py - write a program to download a .txt file from online, open and read
# the file, and then display the output. Note: you do NOT have to display the whole file or write
# to a .txt file (optional). Step 1 â€“ find a .txt file online to work with, other than the example.
# The example program downloads, opens and reads a file, hosted at this address:

# Alice in Wonderland on Project Gutenberg https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
URL="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt"
response = requests.get(URL)

with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    file.write(response.content.decode('utf-8'))
file.close()

readfile_line = readfile.readline()
line_count = 1
while ((readfile_line) and (line_count < 140)):
    print(readfile_line)
    readfile_line = readfile.readline()
    line_count = line_count + 1
